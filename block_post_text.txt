You have almost completed the research survey and we appreciate your time and effort. However, we have to make sure that our data are valid and not biased.

In order to demonstrate that you have read instructions, please select the option "No answer" for the next question that asks about the length of the study and type “I read the instructions” in the box labeled "Any other comments or questions?"
